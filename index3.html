            Cashflow minimization refers to the act of dividing money between friends, roommates, colleagues, 
        relatives and so on. It allows each party to be reimbursed for the expenses they are owed. To 
        make this process efficient our website has been created to ease this experience.
        When someone dines with their friends or shares expenses with their roommates or loved ones 
        it is always a challenge to figure out who owes what to whom. It would be stressful to ask their 
        friends to pay back the money they owe them.
        It would be time-consuming to determine who ordered what and how much they have to pay, 
        incorporating taxes and tip amount in the estimate. And it would seem embarrassing to 
        calculate all this in a restaurant or caf√© where a lot of people are gazing or noticing.

            Using our website you can track bills and other shared expenses among your friends and settle up stuff in the easiest manner possible with the least cashflow. 
            This is the implementation of classical cashflow minimization using max-heaps made using Javascript.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;margin:60px;"> Given a large group of friends who 
            have to give or take some amount of money from one 
            another, we intend to design an algorithm by which the total cash flow among all the friends is 
            minimized. So, a particular friend need not worry about underpaying or overpaying money and 
            pay exactly the net amount that has to be paid. Using this algorithm, we can save a lot of time 
            which would've been spent on calculating it verbally through discussion.</p>
